# Interest Automation & Distribution Graphs - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to automate FD interest processing and add interest distribution visualization features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automated FD Interest Processing

#### `src/lib/cron.js`
- **Added**: Automatic FD interest processing alongside savings interest
- **Schedule**: Runs monthly on the 1st day at 00:05
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `node-fetch` dependency (uses native fetch)
  - Added server-side check (`typeof window === 'undefined'`)
  - Added call to `/api/process-fd-interest` with special cron header
  - Separated error handling for savings and FD interest jobs

#### `src/app/api/process-fd-interest/route.js`
- **Added**: Support for automated cron job execution
- **Changes**:
  - Checks for `X-Cron-Secret` header to identify automated jobs
  - Automated jobs bypass authentication (no user required)
  - Manual triggers still require admin/manager authentication
  - Uses system user ID (1) for automated transactions
  - Maintains branch restrictions for manager manual triggers
  - Admin and automated jobs process all branches

#### `src/app/components/Dashboard.jsx`
- **Removed**: "Process FD Interest" button from all roles
- **Reason**: Interest processing is now fully automated
- **Impact**: Cleaner dashboard, no manual intervention needed

### 2. Interest Distribution Graphs

#### `src/app/api/interest-distributions/route.js` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Fetch aggregated interest distribution data
- **Features**:
  - **Account Type Filter**: All, Savings Only, FD Only
  - **Period Filter**: Monthly or Annually
  - **Group By**: Time Period or Branch
  - **Date Range**: Year and optional month selection
  - **Role-based Access**: Managers see only their branch data
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `accountType`: 'savings', 'fd', or 'all' (default: 'all')
  - `period`: 'monthly' or 'annually' (default: 'monthly')
  - `groupBy`: 'branch' or 'time' (default: 'time')
  - `year`: specific year (default: current year)
  - `month`: specific month 1-12 (optional, only for monthly period)

#### `src/app/components/InterestDistributions.jsx` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Interactive dashboard for viewing interest distributions
- **Features**:
  1. **Branch-wise Distribution**:
     - Horizontal bar charts showing interest by branch
     - Separate bars for savings and FD interest
     - Transaction count displayed on bars
     - Branch name and ID displayed
  
  2. **Time-based Distribution**:
     - Vertical bar charts showing interest over time
     - Monthly view: Shows all 12 months of selected year
     - Daily view: Shows daily breakdown for selected month
     - Annual view: Shows yearly comparison
     - Side-by-side bars for savings vs FD interest
  
  3. **Filter Options**:
     - Account Type: All / Savings Only / FD Only
     - Period: Monthly / Annually
     - Group By: Time Period / Branch
     - Year selector (last 5 years)
     - Month selector (when monthly + time grouping)
  
  4. **Visual Design**:
     - Blue bars for savings account interest
     - Green bars for fixed deposit interest
     - Responsive grid layout
     - Loading and error states
     - Transaction counts shown on bars
     - Formatted currency display

#### `src/app/components/Dashboard.jsx`
- **Added**: "Interest Distributions" button for admins and managers
- **Action**: Opens the new InterestDistributions component
- **Description**: "View interest distribution graphs"

#### `src/app/page.js`
- **Added**: Import for `InterestDistributions` component
- **Added**: Routing case for "InterestDistributions" page
- **Impact**: Users can now navigate to Interest Distributions page

## How It Works

### Automated Interest Processing
1. **Monthly Schedule**: Cron job runs on 1st of each month at 00:05
2. **Savings Interest**: Calculates and credits savings account interest
3. **FD Interest**: Calculates and credits FD interest (30-day cycles)
4. **No User Interaction**: Fully automated, no button clicks needed
5. **Logging**: Console logs show processing details

### Interest Distributions
1. **Access**: Admin and managers can access via Dashboard
2. **Data Fetching**: API aggregates transaction data based on filters
3. **Visualization**: Charts display with responsive design
4. **Filtering**: Real-time updates when filters change
5. **Role-based**: Managers see only their branch data

## Key Features

### Automation Benefits
- ✅ No manual intervention required
- ✅ Consistent processing schedule
- ✅ Automatic transaction recording
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Works for all branches simultaneously

### Distribution Graph Features
- ✅ Multiple view options (branch/time)
- ✅ Account type filtering (savings/FD/all)
- ✅ Period selection (monthly/annually)
- ✅ Date range selection
- ✅ Visual comparison of savings vs FD interest
- ✅ Transaction count display
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Role-based data access

## Data Flow

### Automated Processing
```
Cron Schedule (1st @ 00:05)
    ↓
Call /api/calc-savings-interest (with X-Cron-Secret header)
    ↓
Calculate & Credit Savings Interest
    ↓
Call /api/process-fd-interest (with X-Cron-Secret header)
    ↓
Calculate & Credit FD Interest (30-day cycles)
    ↓
Log Results
```

### Distribution Graphs
```
User Opens Interest Distributions
    ↓
Select Filters (accountType, period, groupBy, year, month)
    ↓
Call /api/interest-distributions with query params
    ↓
API aggregates transaction data
    ↓
Apply role-based filtering
    ↓
Return aggregated results
    ↓
Render charts with data
```

## FD Interest Calculation

The FD interest calculation method remains unchanged:

**Formula**: `Interest = (Amount × Annual Rate × 30) / (365 × 100)`

- Uses 30-day cycles
- Credits interest to linked savings account
- Updates `next_interest_date` automatically
- Records transaction with type 'interest'
- Description: "FD interest"

## Testing Checklist

### Automated Processing
- [ ] Verify cron job initializes on server start
- [ ] Check console logs on 1st of month
- [ ] Confirm savings interest transactions created
- [ ] Confirm FD interest transactions created
- [ ] Verify interest amounts are correct
- [ ] Check next_interest_date updates for FDs

### Interest Distributions
- [ ] Access from Dashboard as admin
- [ ] Access from Dashboard as manager
- [ ] Test branch-wise grouping
- [ ] Test time-based grouping
- [ ] Filter by account type (savings/FD/all)
- [ ] Change period (monthly/annually)
- [ ] Select different years
- [ ] Select specific month
- [ ] Verify managers see only their branch
- [ ] Verify admins see all branches
- [ ] Check chart rendering
- [ ] Verify transaction counts
- [ ] Test with no data available

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CRON_SECRET=internal-cron-job  # Optional, has default value
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**: All routes compiled without errors
✅ **44 Routes**: Including new interest-distributions endpoint
✅ **Cron Initialized**: Console shows successful initialization

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/cron.js` - Added FD interest automation
2. `src/app/api/process-fd-interest/route.js` - Added cron support
3. `src/app/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Removed FD button, added distributions button
4. `src/app/page.js` - Added routing for InterestDistributions

## Files Created

1. `src/app/api/interest-distributions/route.js` - New API endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: The application is ready for deployment
2. **Monitor**: Check cron job logs on 1st of month
3. **Test**: Try the new Interest Distributions feature
4. **Verify**: Confirm automated interest processing works correctly

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check console logs for cron job initialization
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure database connection is working
4. Check that transactions table has 'interest' type data
5. Confirm user roles are set correctly in database
